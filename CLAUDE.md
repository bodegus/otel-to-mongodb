# OpenTelemetry to MongoDB API - Project Specification

## Project Overview

This project implements a production-ready Python FastAPI service that accepts OpenTelemetry (OTEL) JSON documents and writes them to MongoDB instances. The service supports primary/secondary MongoDB storage with automatic failover, designed for deployment in Docker containers or AWS Fargate.

### Core Requirements
- **Simple API**: Accept JSON documents via FastAPI endpoints (/v1/traces, /v1/metrics, /v1/logs)
- **Dual MongoDB**: Write to primary and secondary MongoDB instances with graceful degradation
- **Production Ready**: Comprehensive testing, error handling, structured logging with structlog
- **Containerized**: Docker deployment with Fargate support
- **Well Tested**: Extensive unit tests with MongoDB mocking, integration tests with real containers

## Current Project Status

### Implementation Progress

**âœ… Completed Features:**
- FastAPI application with OTLP endpoints (/v1/traces, /v1/metrics, /v1/logs)
- Primary/secondary MongoDB architecture with graceful degradation
- Structured logging with structlog
- Comprehensive health check endpoints (/health, /health/detailed)
- OTLP-compliant request/response models using Pydantic
- Modern Python tooling with Ruff (unified linting/formatting)
- Unit tests with mongomock integration
- Integration tests with real MongoDB containers
- Pre-commit hooks and CI/CD pipeline

**Architecture Components:**
- `app/main.py`: FastAPI application with lifespan management and global exception handling
- `app/mongo_client.py`: MongoDB client with primary/secondary database support
- `app/otel_service.py`: OpenTelemetry data processing service with telemetry counting
- `app/models.py`: Pydantic models for OTLP data structures and responses
- `app/tests/`: Comprehensive test suite with unit and integration tests

**Current Strengths:**
- Clean separation of concerns between API, service, and database layers
- Environment-based configuration (PRIMARY_MONGODB_URI, SECONDARY_MONGODB_URI)
- Graceful degradation - service continues if only one database is available
- Detailed telemetry processing with record counting and timing metrics
- Modern Python 3.12 codebase with full type annotations

**ðŸ”„ Areas for Enhancement:**
- Authentication and authorization mechanisms
- Rate limiting and request throttling
- OpenTelemetry instrumentation for self-monitoring
- Circuit breaker pattern for database connectivity
- Dead letter queue for failed writes
- Background sync service for consistency recovery
- Performance optimization and caching strategies

### Current Implementation Principles

**âœ… Module Architecture:**
- **Clean Separation**: `main.py` (API) â†’ `otel_service.py` (Business Logic) â†’ `mongo_client.py` (Data Layer)
- **Single Responsibility**: Each module has a focused purpose
- **Dependency Injection**: Services receive dependencies via constructors
- **Type Safety**: Comprehensive type annotations throughout

**âœ… Error Handling:**
- **Global Exception Handler**: Catches all unhandled exceptions with structured logging
- **Graceful Degradation**: Service continues with partial database connectivity
- **OTLP Compliance**: Error responses follow OpenTelemetry protocol standards
- **Structured Logging**: All errors logged with context and correlation IDs

**âœ… Configuration Management:**
- **Environment Variables**: `PRIMARY_MONGODB_URI`, `SECONDARY_MONGODB_URI`, `MONGODB_DATABASE`
- **Sensible Defaults**: Development-friendly defaults for optional configuration
- **No Hardcoded Values**: All configuration externalized

**Git Workflow:**
- Feature branches with descriptive names
- Pre-commit hooks for code quality
- Conventional commit messages
- Pull request reviews required
- Automated testing in CI/CD

### Deployment Considerations
